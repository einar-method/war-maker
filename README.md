# WAR | MAKER
## Notices
This web app is a WIP by Eâ€¢M (maker of the EZ Tools app) with tentative permission from Runehammer. It has been optimized for desktop browsers, but does have some mobile support. In no way is this a finished project, nor do I have vast experience with web development. 

All information sent to the database is deleted when you refresh or close the browser, however, please do not send any private information. Stay safe friends. Speaking of, if you see trackers on this site, it's because it uses the Firebase realtime database (which belongs to Google). In no way am I collecting analytics or any other data.

The War Maker book is currently not available as 2.0 is being worked on. Please check the [Runehammer Store](https://www.runehammer.online/online-store) for more info.
